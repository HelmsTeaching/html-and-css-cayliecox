        <p>I chose to link <font color=#164DFF> "dependent on software"</font>to the <font color=#164DFF>"not reading" website</font> because I think it's a little silly to have students download software and go through all of this work instead of actually reading a book. I don't think the students gain enough from this exercise to make the extra time, effort, and barries worth it.
        <br>
        I chose to link <font color=#9866C7> "design education" </font> to the <font color=#9866C7>"There's no app for good teaching" article</font> because good design education isn't just about throwing some technology at your students, but instead making educational goals and then deciding how technology can help you work towards those goals.
        <br>
        I chose to link <font color=#00AB00>"disproportionately benefits already powerful groups"</font> to the <font color=#00AB00>social justice and digital humanities interactive website</font> because social justice principles provide a very important lens to evaluate design education. We need to be aware of how certain technologies benefit powerful groups at the expense of less-powerful groups.
        <br>
        I chose to link <font color=#F28500>"matrix of domination"</font> to the <font color=#F28500>embodiment and technology website</font> because we need to remember the ideas of intersectionality and that the users of technology--including our students--are real people with real bodies and real lives.
